# Mental_Fitness_Tracker_IBM_Internship_Project
The project focuses on building a mental health tracker.   You will try to get an idea of the mental state of your user (in the least intrusive ways), find out if they are suffering and then suggest measures they can take to get out of their present condition. 

# Agenda
Mental health is an important issue in the world today. With a large population now working from home and staying away from loved ones, the mental health situation has deteriorated. As such, it becomes important to track and remedy any problems before they get too serious.
We try achieving this using the Mental Fitness Tracker. A user answers some questions and based on the answers that they provide, you will suggest tasks to them and maintain a record of their mental state for displaying on a dashboard.

# SOLUTION AND PRESENTATION

The system consists of both hardware and software in order to accurately track the time and attendance . Mental illness is a health problem that undoubtedly impacts emotions, reasoning, and social interaction of a person. To accomplish these strategies, early detection of mental health is an essential procedure.

Machine learning is a technique that aims to construct systems that can improve through experience by using advanced statistical and probabilistic techniques. It is believed to be a significantly useful tool to help in predicting mental health. It is allowing many researchers to acquire important information from the data, provide personalized experiences, and develop automated intelligent systems.

 The widely used algorithms in the field of machine learning such, Logistic Regression , Decision Tree Classifier, K neighbors Classifier , Random Forest Classifier,  AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier etc and have been utilized to forecast and prediction of mental state of an individual that can be analysed through graphs , subplot and heatmap.

# Objective
The project focuses on building a mental health tracker. You will try to get an idea of the mental state of your user (in the least intrusive ways), find out if they are suffering and then suggest measures they can take to get out of their present condition.

The people who will use this tracker will not only get strong will from inside but it will boost their confidence in professional as well as in day to day life.

They will get to know about their pros and cons from inside and this tracker will help them in doing so that they will able to work upon those things that will positively  reflect  in their daily outlook.

According to “Mental Health Tracker” the Following key points in application:-

1) Self-Monitoring 
2) Notifications and Reminders 
3) Dashboard 
4) Recommends Activity and Videos 
5) Privacy
6) Confidentiality
