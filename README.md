# Mental_Fitness_Tracker_IBM_Internship_Project
The project focuses on building a mental health tracker.   You will try to get an idea of the mental state of your user (in the least intrusive ways), find out if they are suffering and then suggest measures they can take to get out of their present condition. 

#Agenda
Mental health is an important issue in the world today. With a large population now working from home and staying away from loved ones, the mental health situation has deteriorated. As such, it becomes important to track and remedy any problems before they get too serious.
We try achieving this using the Mental Fitness Tracker. A user answers some questions and based on the answers that they provide, you will suggest tasks to them and maintain a record of their mental state for displaying on a dashboard.
